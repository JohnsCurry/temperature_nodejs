run with $ nodemon start

converts celcius to fahrenheit and vice versa. Probably not the most elegant
solution but it does work, and it seems pretty clean.

Only thing I think I don't like is the prevTempType and finalTempType
properties of the finishedConversion object.

Maybe there is a better way to dynamically display that information?

I can make the app prettier with some better looking designs, but the app
is "complete".
